 * CombatSystem sets up how fights between user and enemies work in game
 * With no weapons users will have a 50% chance of winning a fight,

 * example: fist - 5 so 5 in 10 chance of winning, pistol has weight of 4 - 5+4 = 9 -> 9 in 10 chance 90%
 * current version only allows one chance, user either wins or loses
